• Lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss
(called credit loss) for consumer finance companies. The credit loss is the
amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or
runs away with the money owed.

• Finance companies want to understand the driving factors (or driver
variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators
of default. The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk
assessment.

•I tried to infer the patterns in the data by doing univariate and bivariate
analysis and find out who is likely to default and should not be approved
loans in the future.
